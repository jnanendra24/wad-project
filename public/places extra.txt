                    <h3>TOKYO TOWER</h3>
                    <p>One of the most striking places to visit in Tokyo is the Tokyo Tower, perhaps the most
                        recognizable
                        structure in all of Japan. Although it is primarily a communications tower, visitors can climb
                        to
                        the
                        summit to observe a panoramic view of Tokyo. The tower is also heavily inspired by the Eiffel
                        Tower
                        in
                        Paris in its structure and architecture. The tower is a symbol of Japanese recovery after the
                        Second
                        World War and the fact that the country has now become a major economic superpower.</p>

                    <h3>THE ISLAND SHRINE OF ITSUKUSHIMA</h3>
                    <p>Itsukushima which is also known as Miyajima is a small island in Hiroshima Bay that is very much
                        popular
                        for its forests and ancient temples. The shrine was initially constructed in the 12th
                        century.Heading
                        over to one of the beautiful places in Japan, you will also get a chance to visit the Museum of
                        History
                        and Folklore, which is home to some of the cultural artifacts that date back to almost the 19th
                        century.

                    <p>If you thought Jigokudani was a steaming pool full of bathing monkeys, then think again. This
                        Jigokudani,
                        although it has the same name as Japan’s famous monkey park, is something entirely different.
                        This
                        Jigokudani is a smoldering volcanic crater which is just like a little piece of hell on earth.
                        It’s
                        a
                        place where the Japanese landscape vents the darker side of its nature in sulfurous geysers and
                        ponds of
                        bubbling mud.</p>

                    <h3>Kabira Bay</h3>
                    <p>Kabira Bay is Japan’s little piece of coastal heaven where crystal-clear azure waters lap against
                        pure
                        white sand. The paradisical bay is located on Ishigaki Island, and while it is one of Japan’s
                        most
                        stunningly beautiful landscapes, it’s not quite the Eden it appears to be. There are strong
                        currents
                        and
                        hoards of jellyfish in the water. Those, combined with the constant back and forth of tourist
                        boats,
                        means swimming is too dangerous an activity to undertake. What the waters in Kabira Bay are
                        perfect
                        for
                        is cultivating black pearls and while that’s something which takes a good few years, the outcome
                        is
                        well
                        worth the wait.</p>

                        go,
                        it’s necessary to go down rather than up. The Akiyoshido Cave is a vast underground cavern which
                        stretches down into the bowels of the earth for over six miles. Carved from the limestone rock
                        by
                        the
                        river which flows through it, this Karst cave is over three hundred feet wide in places. The
                        dark
                        waters
                        of the river act like a mirror reflecting the jagged stalactites which jut from the cave

                        hundred
                        feet, the Nachi Waterfall is Japan’s tallest single drop fall and has been artistically

                        for

                        religious
                        shrines at the site since Japan was first inhabited. Many people still treat it as a place of
                        pilgrimage
                        today and visit the stunning Nachi Taisha shrine which stands before the waterfall.</p>

                        Yakushima
                        Island. This island is not only a haven for animals and one of the best natural sights in Japan,
                        it’s
                        also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. That’s a combination of factors which just have to be
                        explored.
                        The
                        animals on Yakushima Island might be similar species to those on the mainland, but they’re often
                        more
                        diminutive in size. Yaku monkeys, a type of macaques, are a frequent sighting and while smaller

                        their mainland brethren and fun to look at, can be quite aggressive if approached.</p>

                        art. To
                        visit a Japanese garden is to step into a painting. Arguably the most beautiful garden in Japan
                        is
                        the
                        Kenrokuen Garden in Kanazawa. The grounds used to be a part of Kanazawa Castle and were opened

                        the
                        public in the 19th century.What makes the garden so special is that it was designed around what
                        are
                        known as the six essentials to make a perfect garden. These include spaciousness, seclusion,

                    <p>Blue Pond is a man-made pond feature in Biei, Hokkaido, Japan. It is the result of works on the
                        Biei
                        River, carried out after the 1988 eruption of Mount Tokachi, to protect the town of Biei from
                        volcanic
                        mudflows. The colour is thought to result from the accidental presence of colloidal aluminium
                        hydroxide
                        in the water. Damage caused by Typhoon Mindulle in August 2016 resulted in a temporary drop in
                        the
                        water
